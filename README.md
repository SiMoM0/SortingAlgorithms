# SortingAlgorithms
This repository contains the implementation of the most common and useful sorting algorithms:

### Selection Sort
Selection sort scan multiples times the list, in order to find the mininum element and replace it with the one at the beginning of the list, or its sublist.
This algorithms is O(n^2).

### Bubble Sort
Swap elements from the end of the list to the beginning, moving the minor element in the first position of th list/sublist. 
This algorithms is O(n^2). 	

### Merge Sort
A divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn).

### Quick Sort
Another divide and conquer sorting algorithm like Merge Sort. Still a time complexity of O(nlogn)

### Heap Sort
A sorting algorithm based on Binary Heap data structure. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn)
